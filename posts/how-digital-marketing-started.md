Digital marketing, as we know it today, began in the early 1990s with the rise of the internet. The inception of digital marketing is closely tied to the birth of the **World Wide Web** and the increasing access to personal computers and the internet by consumers around the globe.

### The Origins of Digital Marketing

- **1991: The Internet Goes Public**  
  The internet became publicly accessible, paving the way for businesses to use this new platform to reach consumers directly.

- **The First Banner Ad (1994)**  
  One of the earliest significant events in digital marketing history was the launch of the first clickable banner ad by AT&T on HotWired.com. This marked the beginning of online advertising as a viable marketing channel.

- **Search Engine Emergence**  
  Early search engines like Yahoo! and later Google changed how consumers found information, which gave rise to **Search Engine Marketing (SEM)** and **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**. Marketers started focusing on keywords and search rankings to attract traffic.

- **Email Marketing**  
  Email quickly became a popular digital marketing tool for businesses due to its cost-effectiveness and direct line to customers. The potential for personalized and mass communication put email at the core of early digital campaigns.

### Evolution and Expansion

As technology advanced, so did the methods and tools used in digital marketing:

- **Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising** emerged, allowing advertisers to pay only when their ads were clicked.
  
- **Social Media Platforms** like Facebook (launched in 2004) and Twitter (2006) created new channels for marketers to engage with audiences in real-time, amplifying brand presence and interaction.

- The growth of **mobile devices** further transformed digital marketing by enabling location-based marketing, apps, and instant communication.

- The rise of **MarTech (Marketing Technology)** integrated data analytics, automation, and machine learning into campaigns, improving targeting and ROI. For a comprehensive view on Martech tools and their impact, visit [this resource](https://marketer.it.com/posts/martech).
