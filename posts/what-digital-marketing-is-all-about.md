Digital marketing is the practice of promoting products or services using digital channels to reach consumers effectively.

- **Social Media Marketing:** Utilizing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to promote brands and interact with customers.

- **Affiliate Marketing:** Partnering with affiliates who promote products in exchange for commissions.
- **Marketing Automation:** Using software tools to automate repetitive marketing tasks and personalize customer interactions.
